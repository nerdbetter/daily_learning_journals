<h1> Code 201, Day 6 </h1>

<p> Class started well for me, I was worried that I was the only one to not get the sumArray and multipyArray functions to pass through an entire array instead of just the three given functions. I had come very close to the actual solution in my own tie so that made me feel much better. The later day slowed way down for me though, I still don't get the dom real well. As with other things it will probably start to sink in at the end of the week when we have moved on -- haha.
