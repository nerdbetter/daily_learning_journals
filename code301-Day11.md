## Code 301 Day 11

What up fam? Had a super productive weekend at the Iowa Code Camp, really pimped DeltaV Code School. Went over a lot of single page app stuff today. wrote some page.js stuff that seems like the exact same thing I am already doing in my portfolio project, except it handles .get requests. Nothing big top go over as everything was pretty straight forward today. Tune in next time.
