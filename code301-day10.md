## 301 day 10, 21JUL17

So SQL was a pain yesterday, but I worked through some of the SQLBolt stuff and that helped a lot. Going over functional programing today was really interesting. Now arrow functions are going to take some getting used to, especially when using this, so just don't use it in methods.
The last few days of this week were definitely challenging. Went to the Iowa Code Camp on Saturday and got more than just free pizza out of it. Benjamin and I talked about doing a session in November - a Couch to Developer recap you could say. Met some guys and gave out the DeltaV Code web site a few times.
