## Code 301 Day 13

If I am taking too much time on code review let me know, nobody else volunteers and Benjamin's code is perfect :D. I have also been trying to interact more in general with questions and stuff. Turns out I learn more when I'm engaged, whodathunk? Deployment environments make sense , but its going to add another layer to the git flow that may cause conflicts. I hate conflicts.
Heroku is interesting. It's a live app environment - wonder if I can hook it up to my nerdbetter.com as a subdomain, like app.nerdbetter.com.
