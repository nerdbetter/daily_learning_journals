#Project Week Day 1

Starting the project went smoothly overall. I am very glad that my project got selected so I can work on something I will enjoy and continue to improve past Project Week. Overall my team is knowledgeable and so far willing to work together. I appreciate Mitchell's willingness to work on a project he didn't really want to be part of. I hope to use David as a resource to better learn javascript.
