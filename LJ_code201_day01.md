<h1> Code 201, Day 2 </h1>

<p> Went over the basics of html and js. Did some discussion on the book reading - my least favorite, but necessary part. So far everything is smooth and I haven't run into any real problems.s </p>

<h1> Code 201, Day 3 </h>
<p> Today was a great experience. Code review was the first time I really got to see how much different everybody codes. It's like everybody is speaking the same language with different accents or regional dialects - truly fascinating. Struggled with arrays today but learned a ton. </p>
