#Code 301 Day 1

Started 301 today! Yay! Most of today was going over responsive web and icon fonts - icon fonts will be pretty cool. Responsive layout seems to be pretty intensive but I will try to go into everything Mobile First from now on. Really excited to get started on 301 and keep trucking toward a career!
