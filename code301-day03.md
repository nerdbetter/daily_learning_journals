#Code 301 day 3

Holy cow is JQuery cool. I feel like I am breezing through concepts I didn't in the 201. Dom manipulation really gave me fits in 201 but here it's not so bad. My biggest struggle now is tiny things in the code. Last night i beat my head against the keyboard KNOWING it was something stupid - and I just had an extra word that broke everything.
Going over event methods was dense though.
