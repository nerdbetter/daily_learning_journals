#301 Week 2 Day 1, 17JUL17

Solid weekend to refresh - Went over JSON and AJAX in class today, pretty dense subjects but we have already reviewed JSON a bit so it wasn't as bad as it could have been. learned both let and const as variable declarations - let seems handy to keep variables scoped properly. 
Nate presented lecture today and did a good job. I do feel a bit bad he is lecturing with a broke foot and half his vision, give the guy some vacation time!
