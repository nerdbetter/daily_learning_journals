<h1> Code 201, Day 10 </h1>

<p> I continued to struggle with the DOM for much of the week but it really solidified for me after I completely started the dom side over again. after re-working through it I feel much more comfortable now. CSS is going pretty well - I got a slideshow to work! doesn't seem like a big deal in hindsight but I was pretty pumped at the time. So far this class has challenged me -- and that is great! I am really looking forward to continuing this. </p>
