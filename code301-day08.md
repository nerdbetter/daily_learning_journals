Well I missed yesterday due to illness and still feel a bit under the weather today. Luckily yesterday was just setting up npm node.js and I should be able to get caught up pretty quickly there. Today is all SQL all the time, but so far seems not too hard. It's all declarative and type based so it is very structured.   
Most of the actual work was done in the pair programming project and it was mostly reading the code and explaining what it does. This seemed alright for today - actually writing these functions could be difficult.
